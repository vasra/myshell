# myshell

A very basic Linux terminal. Created for practicing with C++ 17 and its new features. If at any points it seems that I overcomplicate things, it is done on purpose, so that I can practice on various stuff.

**To compile, you need C++ 17.** With gcc 11.2.0, I run:

```bash
g++ myshell.cpp -o myshell.exe --std=c++17
```
